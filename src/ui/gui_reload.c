/* See gui_reload.h for what this does and does not touch.
 *
 * gui_soft_reload()'s sequence, and why the order matters:
 *
 *  1. gui_shell_reset_drag_state() first, before anything else -- cancels
 *     any interactive player-swipe/quick-drawer drag still in flight (its
 *     own slide_transition_cancel(&player_swipe_ctx) call touches from_scr/
 *     to_scr/img_from/img_to, all about to be deleted below; run any later
 *     and that becomes a use-after-free). A COMMITTED (non-interactive)
 *     slide animation has no such direct cancel path -- gui_reload_request()
 *     refuses to even schedule this function while one is still animating
 *     (see its own comment) rather than trying to tear down mid-transition.
 *  2. gui_library_prepare_for_ui_reload() joins artwork/search jobs that
 *     carry pointers into the screens about to be deleted. Database scans
 *     and SD formatting defer the reload before this sequence begins.
 *  3. reset_swipe_dead_zones() -- every native slider registers itself here
 *     once at startup and is never expected to unregister (see its own
 *     comment); without clearing it first, the sliders each module's
 *     _teardown() is about to delete would leave point_in_swipe_dead_zone()
 *     dereferencing freed pointers on the next swipe check.
 *  4. gui_navigation_teardown() -- resets the nav stack and destroys its own
 *     snapshot/transition-cache buffers. Does NOT delete any screen itself
 *     (each screen is owned and freed by its own module, right below).
 *  5. Every module's own _teardown(): lv_obj_del()s the screens/popups it
 *     owns, INCLUDING any recurring lv_timer_t its _init() unconditionally
 *     (re)creates (volume_popup_hide_timer, lyrics_timer, text_entry_
 *     multitap_timer) -- left running, the old (leaked) timer's own
 *     callback keeps firing forever and mutates whichever NEW timer the
 *     global variable it reads now points to, instead of the dead one that
 *     actually fired. Order among these modules doesn't matter -- none of
 *     them reference another module's screen directly (only via nav_stack/
 *     snapshot state, already cleared in step 4).
 *  6. lv_image_cache_drop(NULL) -- drops LVGL's entire image+header cache in
 *     one call (confirmed via lvgl/src/misc/cache/lv_image_cache.c), so
 *     every icon re-decodes from disk against current theme_overrides/
 *     content once screens are rebuilt below.
 *  7. plugin_manager_deinit() -- drains async HTTP/interval-timer/pending-
 *     text-input work still referencing a plugin's lua_State, then closes
 *     every plugin's L and zeroes every list-item/tile/callback/event-
 *     subscriber registry. Must run after every screen plugins could have
 *     attached a callback to is already gone (a plugin's on_click callback
 *     firing against a half-torn-down screen would be worse than firing
 *     against none at all).
 *  8. gui_theme_reload_styles() -- resets style globals to this app's own
 *     defaults BEFORE plugins reapply on top in step 9, mirroring gui_
 *     init()'s own boot order MINUS fallback_font_init_early(): that call
 *     is boot-only (always rebuilds every app_font_* slot with fallback
 *     faces excluded, relying on a separate one-time background load to
 *     add CJK/Korean/Thai support afterward) -- repeating it on a reload
 *     would silently drop that already-loaded fallback chain and leak the
 *     fallback faces it's replacing, for no benefit a theme/icon reload
 *     needs. Its own guard (see gui_theme.c) resets each lv_style_t before
 *     re-lv_style_init()-ing it, rather than leaking the previous
 *     properties allocation the way a bare second lv_style_init() call
 *     would (same fix applied to screen_builders_init_list_row_style()'s
 *     own 9 styles).
 *  9. plugin_manager_init() -- BEFORE any screen is rebuilt, same as real
 *     boot (gui_init() calls it before gui_player_init() etc. too): Books/
 *     Settings/Stream Media read the list-item/tile registries plugin_
 *     manager_init() populates AT BUILD TIME to append plugin-contributed
 *     rows, so calling it after rebuilding those screens (as an earlier
 *     version of this function mistakenly did) would build them with zero
 *     plugin rows every time.
 * 10. Rebuild every screen, same order gui_init() builds them in.
 * 11. gui_navigation_init() -- re-registers the snapshot screens and
 *     restores nav_stack/nav_depth to Home, loading it. No separate
 *     "restore navigation" step is needed; this already does it.
 *
 * Never touches: audio_init(), settings_load(), volume/backlight/LED/
 * charge-limiter/timezone reapply, hostname_apply(), usb_mode detection,
 * the network_modes_changed forcing block, library_load_from_cache_only(),
 * playlist_files_migrate_to_relative(), the Subsonic-cache auto-resume/Car
 * Mode last-track logic (documented crash history -- boot-only), update_
 * timer_cb (created once at real boot, already running continuously -- a
 * second lv_timer_create() here would duplicate it), or start_refresh_bt_
 * icon()/start_bt_dac_startup_reapply_if_needed() (Bluetooth-adjacent
 * startup side effects -- gui_shell_build_screens() deliberately excludes
 * both, unlike gui_shell_init()). */
