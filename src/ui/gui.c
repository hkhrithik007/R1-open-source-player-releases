/* Real-device bug report: waking from suspend needed two power-button

 * resume_from_suspend_fixups()'s own lv_display_trigger_activity() call)
 * and treated this window as covering only a rare, secondary race -- real
 * diagnostic logging during a live repro instead found this window itself
 * to be the actual remaining cause. hw_buttons.c only sets its
 * short-tap-consumed flag on the button's RELEASE, not the initial press
 * that wakes the kernel (see its own handle_key_event(), value==0 branch) --
 * and a real capture measured 2350ms between this window being armed (right
 * as power_suspend_now() returns, at/near the press that woke the kernel)
 * and that same press's release finally being consumed, comfortably past
 * the old 1000ms budget. Once the window auto-expires "unused," that
 * release is read as a brand new deliberate toggle-off press instead of
 * being recognized as the wake press's own echo -- exactly the "press 1
 * wakes then immediately goes dark, press 2 actually wakes it" report.
 * Raised with real margin above that measured gap. Short grace window, not
 * a one-shot drain: the physical press that wakes the kernel is captured by
 * hw_buttons.c's own independent evdev reader thread, whose timing relative
 * to this (main) thread's own resume handling isn't guaranteed -- a drain
 * attempted too early could miss a flag that thread hadn't set yet. Any
 * power-button press consumed within this window of a resume is treated as
 * an echo of the wake press and silently discarded rather than toggling the
 * screen; a genuinely deliberate second press to go back to sleep right
 * after waking landing inside this now-longer window is a rarer, but

 * no equivalent, racing straight into screen-building and Bluetooth polling
 * within ~2s of process start. Called from main.c immediately after the
 * framebuffer is ready, before any of gui_init()'s own (much heavier) setup
 * work, so this is the very first thing this app ever paints, and so the
 * elapsed-time math in gui_init()'s own wait (see boot_splash_start_tick's
 * use below) is measured from as close to true process start as possible.
 *
 * Uses asset_path("boot_animation/en/0.jpg"), the same baseline-JPEG file
 * the bootloader itself draws (src/bootloader/main.c's BOOTLOADER_BG_PATH),
 * rather than the source 0.png sibling -- real-device testing showed a
 * visible pop at the handoff pan-swap when this screen decoded the PNG:
 * pixel-identical regions of the same artwork still differ by up to ~65/255
 * per channel against the bootloader's JPEG re-encode (block-edge/gradient
 * artifacts from that lossy pass), which reads as a flicker at the instant
 * the display pans to this screen's page even though the pan itself is
 * atomic. Decoding the exact same file (LV_USE_TJPGD, already enabled)
 * makes this repaint byte-for-byte identical to what was already on
 * screen, so the swap is invisible.
 *
 * This app's own THEME_ROOT (theme2) has no boot_animation asset at all --
 * only theme1 does, and that file is the stock "HIBY" wordmark, which this
 * project deliberately doesn't ship (see 89d7ca6d9, "rename app off the
 * HiBy trademark"). asset_path()'s existing THEME_OVERRIDE_ROOT check
 * (assets.c) means a non-trademarked replacement dropped at
 * /usr/data/theme_overrides/boot_animation/en/0.jpg is picked up
 * automatically with no code change or reflash. Until that file exists,
 * the underlying decode simply fails and lv_image renders nothing --
 * SCREEN_BG_COLOR alone still gives a clean black screen instead of
 * whatever the framebuffer previously held, so this is safe either way.
 *
 * Real-device bug report: the status bar (build_status_bar(), and every
 * other overlay this app builds the same way -- popups, quick drawer,
 * volume popup) parents itself onto lv_layer_top(), LVGL's global overlay
 * layer that renders above whichever screen is active *regardless* of
 * lv_screen_load() -- it's not scoped to gui_shell_get_home_screen() at all. Since
 * gui_init() builds the status bar (and starts populating its icons) while
 * this splash is still the loaded screen, it was appearing on top of the
 * splash within about a second of boot, well before gui_init()'s own
 * settle-wait even finished -- reading as "the splash barely showed" even
 * though the splash screen object itself stayed loaded for the full
 * BOOT_SPLASH_MIN_DISPLAY_MS (confirmed via boot_debug.log timestamps).
 * Hiding the whole top layer here and revealing it once gui_init()'s wait
