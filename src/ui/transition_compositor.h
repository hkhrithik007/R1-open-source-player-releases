/* Direct RGB565 two-panel transition compositor -- TRANSITION_PERFORMANCE_
 * PLAN.md Phase 3. Renders the sliding-screen transition (see gui.c's
 * slide_transition_ctx_t/begin_slide_transition()) with plain scanline
 * memcpy()s straight into the inactive physical framebuffer page, panning
 * to it once each frame is fully composed, instead of asking LVGL's
 * software renderer to redraw two moving lv_image objects on every single
 * animation frame. Only usable when the fbdev driver's own pan-based double
 * buffering is active (see lv_linux_fbdev_begin_external_composition()) --
 * gui.c always keeps its existing LVGL-image-object overlay as the fallback
 * for when it isn't (host/SDL builds, or any future display driver), or
 * when any step here fails.
 *
 * Both from/to must be COMPLETE, full-screen, opaque RGB565 frames -- the
 * whole visible display, not just a bare screen-object snapshot. Neither
 * gui.c's live framebuffer copy (see lv_linux_fbdev_get_active_page()) nor
 * a flattened target-screen render (see build_flattened_transition_frame()
 * in gui.c) omit the persistent status bar / home-indicator content the
 * way a bare lv_snapshot_take(some_screen, ...) would -- this module has no
 * concept of "margins" to separately preserve; every row of both sources
 * slides together as one image, which is the only way either bar actually
 * moves correctly instead of staying stationary or getting blanked. */

/* Attempts to switch an already-built slide transition into direct-
 * framebuffer compositing mode. from/to must each be a full-screen,
 * complete (persistent-layer content included), opaque RGB565 draw buffer,
 * and MUST be independently owned -- never a live alias of real
 * framebuffer memory. to_offset is the same +width/-width convention
 * slide_transition_anim_x_cb() uses (the incoming frame's position relative
 * to the outgoing one). When reveal is true, the incoming frame stays
 * stationary at (0, 0) for the entire transition while the outgoing frame
 * slides off to reveal it.
 *
 * The two physical framebuffer pages ping-pong every frame (writing into
 * whichever page is currently inactive, then presenting it). A live-aliased
 * `from` buffer would overlap with the write destination, causing memory
 * corruption. Callers must ensure `from` and `to` are independent copies
 * rather than aliases of active framebuffer memory (see
 * transition_compositor_available()).
 *
 * On success: takes ownership of the fbdev driver's page presentation
 * (lv_linux_fbdev_begin_external_composition()) and disables LVGL
 * invalidation (lv_display_enable_invalidation()) for the duration -- the
 * caller must not create any LVGL overlay/image objects for this
 * transition at all (nothing would ever be drawn while this is active) and
 * must call transition_compositor_end() exactly once later, committed or
 * cancelled either way, before doing anything else that expects normal
 * LVGL rendering to work.
 *
 * Returns false (no state changed at all -- safe to just keep using the
 * existing LVGL-object overlay unmodified) if direct framebuffer access
 * isn't available on this display, a compositor session is already
 * active, or either buffer isn't a plain, full-screen, opaque RGB565
 * buffer of the expected shape. */

 * based double buffering active) -- doesn't guarantee a later
 * transition_compositor_begin() call will actually succeed (buffer shape is
 * still checked there), but is cheap and stable enough to call earlier, so
 * gui.c can decide whether its transition source buffers need to be owned
 * copies (see transition_compositor_begin()'s own comment on why a live
 * alias isn't safe here) before it has them in hand yet. */

 * outgoing frame effectively at x=v, the incoming one at x=v+to_offset --
 * same convention slide_transition_anim_x_cb() uses -- except in reveal
 * mode, where the incoming frame stays pinned at x=0 for the whole
 * gesture instead). Every row from y=0
 * through height-1 is recomposited from `from`/`to` on every call -- no
 * row is ever skipped, re-stamped from a fixed source, or left untouched,
 * so the persistent status bar / home-indicator content (already baked
 * into both full-frame sources) slides exactly like the rest of the
 * screen.
 *
 * Returns false if no compositor session is currently active (transition_
 * compositor_begin() never succeeded, or transition_compositor_end()
 * already ran -- a harmless no-op call, e.g. a stray late animation
 * tick), OR if presenting this frame failed for real. The two cases are
 * NOT the same to the caller: a hard presentation failure means the
 * session has already been torn down internally (transition_compositor_
 * end() runs automatically -- LVGL invalidation restored, buf_act re-
 * synced) before this returns, and the physical display is now showing an
 * unknown intermediate frame with no further compositor frames coming.
 * The caller (gui.c's slide_transition_anim_x_cb()) MUST treat any false
 * return as "this transition cannot continue or be committed" and revert
 * its own ctx/navigation-stack bookkeeping accordingly -- continuing to
 * treat the gesture as live, or committing to the destination screen,
 * would leave GUI-level state disagreeing with what's actually on screen. */
