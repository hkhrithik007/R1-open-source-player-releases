     * DAC mode has its own ~2s wait before it first touches audio_output
     * (usb_dac_bridge.c), which in practice dwarfs that window.
     *
     * The specific most-exposed path -- local playback resuming immediately
     * after this -- is narrowed at the caller level, not here: airplay_
     * control_disconnect_active_stream() (airplay_control.h), the only
     * caller that hands the device straight to local playback right after
     * stopping this bridge, polls airplay_bridge_is_stopped() with a
     * bounded (2s) wait before proceeding. In the ordinary case that wait
     * succeeds well within its bound (bridge_state normally reaches BRIDGE_
     * STOPPED within roughly one POLL_INTERVAL_MS, and only reaches it after
     * run_session() has already closed the device itself, see bridge_
     * thread_func()'s own comment), so by the time that caller returns, this
     * thread has, in practice, already released the device. That is a
     * bounded wait, NOT a guarantee: if the bridge thread is somehow still
     * not reporting stopped after the full 2s (would require it to be
     * genuinely wedged, not just slow), that caller proceeds to resume local
     * playback anyway rather than hang indefinitely -- logging the
     * exceptional case rather than eliminating the resulting race, so this
     * is narrowed to a near-impossible-in-practice window, not closed to
     * zero. A plain settings-screen toggle-off (airplay_toggle_cb()) still
     * doesn't wait at all -- nothing there needs the device back
     * synchronously, and blocking it would freeze the UI for no benefit; a
     * user manually toggling AirPlay off and then tapping Play within
     * roughly one POLL_INTERVAL_MS of each other (sub-50ms, not achievable
     * by human reaction time) is a second, separate, un-narrowed residual
     * through that path. Closing either residual fully would need a shared
     * ownership-arbitration mechanism across audio.c/usb_dac_bridge.c/this
     * file -- a larger, separate change than this bridge's own files can
     * safely make alone. */
