/* The Stock player's proprietary framebuffer backend opens

 * allocation (confirmed from a live order-11 allocation failure in

 * the time the boot selector has decoded its background, allocated its
 * buffers, scanned the SD card, and waited for a choice, the small 56 MiB
 * system can have enough total free RAM but no order-11 buddy block left.
 * Stock then continues without a framebuffer and the last boot-menu frame
 * appears frozen even though the rest of Stock is alive.
 *
 * Reserve that exact driver allocation before this process performs any
 * substantial allocation. Holding the fd keeps the contiguous block out
 * of the general allocator throughout the menu. It deliberately remains
 * open across fork: the child inherits the same open-file reference, the
 * parent then closes its copy, and O_CLOEXEC releases the child's final
 * reference inside a successful execve(). This is materially later than
 * closing before fork -- real-device testing showed that the freshly freed
 * order-11 block could otherwise be split by fork/ELF-loader allocations
 * before Stock opened the driver itself. If execve() fails, CLOEXEC has not
 * fired and the fallback exec remains protected. Open Player does not use
 * this device, but follows the same handoff for consistent fd hygiene. A
 * failed reservation is logged but never blocks boot; Stock then retains
 * its existing best-effort behavior. */
