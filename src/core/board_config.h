 *     standard src/bootloader/fb_draw.h's own comment already relies on:

/* Player (Now Playing) screen composition -- a full-bleed cover-art image,

 * overlap. Both pieces are real, fixed-size PNG assets shipped in each
 * device's OWN stock firmware (usr/resource/litegui/theme2/playing_plane/
 * default_cover_565.png and buttom.png -- see assets.c's THEME_ROOT), not
 * something this app generates, so these constants must track each
 * device's own real asset dimensions exactly, not an arbitrary split:
 *   - R1: default_cover_565.png is 480x480, buttom.png is 480x320
 *     (480+320=800, this codebase's own long-standing values).
 *   - R3Pro II: confirmed directly from the extracted stock firmware's own
 *     theme2 assets -- default_cover_565.png measures 480x460, buttom.png
 *     measures 480x260 (460+260=720). HiBy's own stock UI already solved
 *     this exact layout problem for this panel; these numbers are read
 *     from their asset files, not derived.
 *   - R3II 2025: Confirmed by referencing buttom.png from v1.3 of
 *     r3ii_2025.upt (320x170) and subtracting that from the screen height */
