 * never all the way down to a literal 0 (see BACKLIGHT_MIN_PERCENT below),
 * and never the literal max_brightness value either -- confirmed live on a
 * real R1 that writing that exact raw value makes the screen fully
 * invisible instead of "as bright as possible" (a PWM-at-max-duty-cycle
 * glitch, not something fixable from software beyond just never writing
 * that value). Callers never need to think about either edge themselves. */

 * to adjust back upward. */
