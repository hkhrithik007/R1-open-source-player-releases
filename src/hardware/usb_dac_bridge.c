 * (c_chmask=0x03/c_ssize=2/c_srate=48000) -- confirmed empirically against
 * a real device instead, since the driver's actual behavior doesn't match
 * what it advertises (see usb_dac_bridge.h for why the real protocol
 * isn't known and this is empirical rather than derived):
 *   - Channels: of the two interleaved 16-bit slots per frame, only the
 *     second one (index 1) ever carries real audio -- the first is
 *     full-scale noise on every capture, not silence. Verified by
 *     comparing zero-crossing rate/amplitude of each slot in a raw capture,
 *     and that a byte-level shift doesn't fix it (rules out a framing
 *     offset -- it's a per-slot behavior, not misalignment). Worked around
 *     by overwriting the noise slot with the real one before playback
 *     rather than declaring 1 channel, since duplicating into fake stereo
 *     is simpler than reconfiguring tinyalsa/the hardware path for mono.
 *   - Rate: wall-clock-measured actual frame arrival rate on a real device
 *     converged to ~96300 frames/s, not the declared 48000 -- and 96000
 *     is also what sounded correct to a human listener, independently
 *     confirming the measurement. */
