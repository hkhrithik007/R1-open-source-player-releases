# This project's own LVGL checkout (gitignored -- real upstream source,
# not ours to redistribute) carries three categories of local
# customization that upstream v9.1.0 does not have, all needed for a
# clean GitHub clone to both LINK and BEHAVE like this developer's tree
# (see ISSUES.md's "clean GitHub clones cannot link the transition
# compositor" entry -- fixing only the first category still leaves a
# clean-cloned build behaviorally different, which is exactly the mistake
# that entry warns against):
#
#   1. fbdev compositor (patches/lvgl_fbdev_compositor.patch): six
#      functions (lv_linux_fbdev_get_active_page/get_inactive_page/
#      get_stride/begin_external_composition/present_external_page/
#      end_external_composition) that transition_compositor.c and
#      gui_navigation.c call to drive pan-flip transition animations
#      directly against the two physical framebuffer pages. Missing
#      entirely from upstream -- a clean clone fails to link with
#      "undefined reference to `lv_linux_fbdev_get_active_page'" (and the
#      other five) the moment either caller is linked in.
#   2. runtime fixes (patches/lvgl_runtime_fixes.patch): four small
#      genuine upstream bugs/limitations this app hit in practice, not
#      feature work -- lv_tiny_ttf_init()/_deinit() missing a null-guard (a
#      second init call, or deinit after a failed init, double-destroys/
#      leaks the shared font cache) plus two error paths in
#      lv_tiny_ttf_create() that leaked an open font-file handle;
#      _lv_cache_lru_rb.c's drop_all_cb() destroyed the cache's red-black
#      tree without reinitializing it, so any cache use after a full clear
#      (e.g. a settings change that invalidates cached UI bitmaps) operated
#      on a destroyed tree; tjpgdcnf.h's JD_USE_SCALE was left at the
#      upstream default of 0, disabling TJpgDec's own output downscaling
#      that this app's album-art path uses to decode cover JPEGs at the
#      largest 2^n that still covers the target, then cover-fit, instead of
#      full-size-then-software-resize (see ISSUES.md's Albums-screen
#      overheat/OOM entry); tjpgd.c's jd_mcu_output was also missing ChaN's
#      1/2 and 1/4 MCU averaging and 1/8 DC RGB path, so scale!=0 was unusable
#      until restored here (BGR order, matching this copy's full-MCU loop);
#      lv_tiny_ttf_init() also hardcoded its shared rasterized-glyph LRU
#      cache to 128 entries -- fine for this app's default Montserrat
#      tiers, which are pre-baked bitmap fonts (lv_font_montserrat_*, see
#      the generated-fonts category below) that never touch this cache at
#      all, but the moment Settings > Display > Font applies a custom SD
#      card .ttf, every one of app_font_16/20/22/28/lyrics (fallback_font.c)
#      becomes a runtime-rasterized tiny_ttf instance sharing this one
#      global cache -- a scrolling list cycling through more distinct
#      glyphs than that across those sizes evicts and re-rasterizes
#      (STB truetype software rasterization) on nearly every frame, which
#      is exactly the real-device report ("selecting an SD card font lags
#      the device, scroll lists become slow"). Bumped to 512: each cached
#      glyph is a small LV_COLOR_FORMAT_A8 bitmap sized to its own glyph
#      box (tiny_ttf_cache_create_cb()), so worst case (512 of the largest
#      BlindMF-tier glyphs) is still under ~1MB against this device's
#      ~19MB available RAM, comfortably covering several font sizes' full
#      alphanumeric+punctuation working sets at once without the earlier
#      128-entry thrashing.
#   3. generated fonts (patches/lvgl_generated_fonts/, copied in whole
#      rather than diffed): ten Montserrat .c files regenerated with an
#      expanded lv_font_conv codepoint range (Latin-1 Supplement +
#      Latin Extended-A + typographic punctuation added to upstream's
#      bare ASCII range -- each font file's own header comment records
#      the exact lv_font_conv invocation) so real-world artist/album
#      metadata with accented characters (a Spanish name, Latin Extended-A
#      characters like "a" with a macron, ...) or curly quotes/en-dashes
#      renders correctly instead of showing tofu boxes or nothing at all.
#      Originally only the four "Small" Font Size tier sizes (16/20/22/28,
#      see fallback_font.c's get_montserrat_font_for_px()) were regenerated
#      -- a real-device bug report ("Spanish accents/Latin Extended-A
#      characters not rendered by the default font") traced this to the
#      Medium/BlindMF tiers' six sizes (24/26/30/32/34/40, lv_conf.h's own
#      comment on LV_FONT_MONTSERRAT_24 etc.) still being pristine upstream
#      LVGL fonts with the stock bare-ASCII-plus-degree-sign range (`-r
#      0x20-0x7F,0xB0,0x2022`, confirmed by reading their own pre-patch
#      header comments) -- regenerated the same way to close the gap
#      regardless of which Font Size tier is active. These are
#      machine-generated hex-array files with no stable diff context
#      (every glyph/kerning table shifts on any range change), so unlike
#      the two patches above they are tracked and restored as whole-file
#      copies rather than a text diff -- diffing them would be both far
#      larger than the files themselves and fragile to patch fuzz.
#
# LVGL_PINNED_COMMIT is v9.1.0's tag commit (the tag object peels to this
# -- `git ls-remote https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl.git refs/tags/
# v9.1.0^{}`), checked before touching anything so none of the three
# categories above can silently apply to a different LVGL revision and
# produce a corrupted tree.
#
# All three are applied/verified by one real stamp-file TARGET
# (LVGL_PATCH_STAMP below, wired as a NORMAL prerequisite -- not
# order-only -- on every object pattern rule that compiles either LVGL or
# this app's own sources). Two independent reasons neither the stamp nor
# the normal-prerequisite choice can be relaxed: (1) app code needs the
# patched lv_linux_fbdev.h visible at ITS OWN compile time too, not just
# LVGL's -- without real prototypes, an implicit declaration of a
# pointer-returning function is undefined behavior on the mipsel target,
# not just a warning; (2) this project has no per-file #include
# dependency tracking (no -MMD/.d generation anywhere in this Makefile),
# so if a future revision of any of the three categories changes what
# callers see, only a NORMAL prerequisite forces every object --
# including ones some earlier build already compiled and cached -- to be
# reconsidered against the new stamp timestamp; an order-only prerequisite
# only guarantees the stamp exists before a first build, not that
# already-built objects get rebuilt when it changes later, silently
# reintroducing stale-ABI object files.
#
# This is a real stamp-file target rather than another parse-time
# $(shell ...) block like the clones above because a parse-time $(shell
# git clone ...) call's exit status is never checked by Make -- a failed
# clone would silently fall through to a confusing "missing symbols for
# half of LVGL" failure much further downstream. A real target's recipe
# can fail loudly and stop the build exactly where the real problem is,
# which matters more here than for the plain clones above because this
# step has far more ways to fail on its own (wrong LVGL revision, a patch
# doesn't apply, a partially-patched tree, a patch updated since last
# applied, a generated font file that matches neither pristine nor the
# tracked golden copy) than a plain clone does.
